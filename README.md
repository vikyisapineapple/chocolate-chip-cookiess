There are a few tips to making these cookies really delicious: First, whip the butter well before adding the rest of the ingredients. Then when the dough is made, refrigerate it  for 1-2 hours or until firm. Finally, be sure you preheat the oven to 350 degrees before baking the cold cookie dough. This will ensure moist and soft cookies.
